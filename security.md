# Security Policy - The Vixen Discord Bot

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of The Vixen Discord bot:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Overview

The Vixen Discord bot is designed with security as a priority. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and what users can expect regarding data protection.

## Data Security

### Data Processing
- **No Persistent Storage**: User data is processed in memory only and not stored permanently
- **API Integration**: Real-time data retrieval from PluralKit API without local caching
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only Discord IDs and command parameters are processed
- **Automatic Cleanup**: All temporary data is cleared on bot restart

### Communication Security
- **Encrypted Channels**: All Discord communications use Discord's encrypted channels
- **HTTPS APIs**: All external API calls use secure HTTPS connections
- **Token Security**: Bot tokens and API keys are securely managed and not exposed
- **No Man-in-the-Middle**: Direct Discord API communication without proxy services

### Access Control
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Bot permissions are limited to necessary functions only
- **No Administrative Access**: No access to Discord administrative functions
- **Controlled Deployment**: Secure deployment practices with limited access
- **Environment Isolation**: Production and development environments are separated

## Privacy Protection

### User Privacy
- **No Message Logging**: Messages are processed but not stored or logged
- **No User Profiling**: No creation of user profiles or behavior tracking
- **Real-time Processing**: All data processing occurs in real-time without retention
- **Anonymous Usage**: No linking of usage patterns to individual users

### PluralKit Integration Security
- **API-Only Access**: No direct database access, only through PluralKit's public API
- **User-Controlled Data**: All PluralKit data remains under user control
- **No Data Modification**: Read-only access except for user-initiated switch registration
- **Respect Privacy Settings**: Honor PluralKit privacy settings for all data requests

## Infrastructure Security

### Bot Infrastructure
- **Secure Hosting**: Bot runs on secure, monitored infrastructure
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies and runtime environments are regularly updated
- **Isolated Environment**: Bot runs in isolated containers with minimal attack surface
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for unusual activity or errors

### Code Security
- **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Initial Contact
- **Email**: Send details to our security team (if email available)
- **GitHub**: Create a private security advisory on our GitHub repository
- **Discord**: Contact bot developers directly through Discord (for non-critical issues)

### 2. Information to Include
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Your assessment of the potential impact
- **Proof of Concept**: Safe proof-of-concept if applicable
- **Suggested Fix**: Proposed solution if you have one

### 3. What NOT to Include
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before we've addressed it
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond demonstrating its existence
- Do not access or modify data belonging to others
- Do not perform DoS attacks or disrupt service

### Response Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Acknowledgment | Within 24 hours | We confirm receipt of your report |
| Initial Assessment | Within 72 hours | We provide initial severity assessment |
| Investigation | 1-2 weeks | We investigate and develop a fix |
| Resolution | 2-4 weeks | We deploy the fix and verify resolution |
| Disclosure | After fix | Public disclosure coordination |

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (P0)
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data breach or exposure
- Service disruption affecting all users

#### High (P1)
- Authentication bypass
- Unauthorized data access
- Significant privacy violations
- Service disruption affecting many users

#### Medium (P2)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service (limited impact)
- Security misconfigurations
- Moderate privacy concerns

#### Low (P3)
- Minor information leaks
- Security improvements
- Best practice violations
- Minimal impact issues

## Security Measures

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated against expected formats
- Command parameters are sanitized before processing
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- Malformed requests are safely rejected

### Authentication & Authorization
- Discord OAuth2 for user identification
- Bot token authentication for Discord API
- No additional authentication systems required
- Permissions verified through Discord's permission system

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data storage eliminates data breach risks
- All API communications are encrypted in transit
- No local databases or file storage of user data
- Memory-only processing with automatic cleanup

### Monitoring & Logging
- Error monitoring without exposing user data
- Performance monitoring for service health
- Security event detection and alerting
- No logging of user messages or personal information

## Third-Party Security

### Discord API
- Relies on Discord's security infrastructure
- Uses official Discord.js library with security updates
- Follows Discord's API best practices and rate limits
- Regular updates to Discord API versions

### PluralKit API
- Uses PluralKit's public API endpoints only
- Respects PluralKit's rate limits and usage policies
- No direct access to PluralKit's underlying data
- Honors PluralKit's privacy and security settings

### Dependencies
- Regular security updates for all dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Trusted sources only for third-party packages

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Automated monitoring for unusual activity
- User reports of suspicious behavior
- Security scanning and testing
- Community feedback and observations

### Response Process
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Limit potential damage or exposure
3. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and scope
4. **Remediation**: Implement fixes and improvements
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes

### Communication
- Transparent communication about security issues
- User notification for issues affecting them
- Public disclosure after resolution
- Regular security updates and advisories
